During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. \n\n(2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (&#8220;ASRs&#8221;). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company&#8217;s common stock during the ASRs&#8217; purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 18 \n\nCompany Stock Performance \n\nThe following graph shows a comparison of five-year cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend-reinvested basis, for the Company, the S&#38;P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index.
